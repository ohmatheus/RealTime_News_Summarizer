# RealTime_News_Summarizer
Using DeepSeek + Langchain for realtime summarizing news from selected web sites with API calls and scrapping.

## About This Project
Just a tiny project to develop my skills with langchain, scrapping, RAG, and usage of deepseek.
The idea is to have an app prompting user for news on a specific topic on the last 24h (may be a variable). Using langchain for RAG and automation. scrapping (beautifulsoup4), and deepseek for summerizing. 
As i am french, my goal is to make this work with one of the major news french website : [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/).

For the sake of this project, this will stay a POC and I would use all the least resource-intensive methods. Namely the lightest distilled model from deepseek : [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) using Qwen-1.5B architecture finetuned on data generated by DeepSeek R1 showing very goodresults. Should be enought for summarization. We will talk about possible improvements at the end of the project.

## Todo/Roadmap
- [ ] POC on google API calls in notebook. Just play and see.
- [ ] Play a little with deepseek on a notebook, check everything works. Check if possible to use from huggingface's transformers and AutoModelForCausalLM. Make some inference. Eventually save model locally. Use quantization if needed.
- [ ] Familiarizing oneself with the uses of LangChain. Understand usages, check source code, API, etc.
- [ ] Start 1st poc with GoogleNewsAPIWrapper (should not need extensive scrapping) -> create corpus.
- [ ] Check from coprus how to "rag this up" with langchain.
- [ ] 1st streamlit app and putting it all together. Also host it on the cloud, find free solution if possible.
- [ ] Scrapping Le Monde.
